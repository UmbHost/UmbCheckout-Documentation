# Product Variants

You can use product variants to define different variants of a product, such as giving the option to select a colour or size.

To create a variant you simply need to allow your Product Document Type to have children, the only required field on the child document type is `umbCheckoutPrice` our demo store shows how you can configure this.

Our recommendation is to configure the product variant to have no Template associated with it, however, you can integrate as you see fit or as your project requires.
