# Stripe Email Notifications

Stripe can notify you of account activity via email, including when:

* A payment is successfully made to your Stripe account
* A payment is disputed by a cardholder
* A payment is marked as elevated risk by Stripe or by a custom rule in Stripe Radar
* An application fee is collected from a connected account (if you are a Stripe Connect platform that collects application fees from connected accounts)
