# Developer License

Upon purchasing a paid license or hosting package, you can request a developer license which can be used on localhost, \*.local or \*.mypc domains, otherwise it's valid for 60 days.

If your license is part of a hosting package, it will only remain valid for the life of the subscription.

To request a developer license please [create an account](https://my.umbhost.net/register.php) and then [open a support ticket here](https://my.umbhost.net/submitticket.php?step=2\&deptid=2).

**Please include the domains to be added to the license in the request.**

It is only possible to request 1 license and 1 development license per domain.

Production and Staging licenses are available on request for every domain hosted on an active UmbHost hosting package.
