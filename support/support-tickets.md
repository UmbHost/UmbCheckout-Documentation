# Support Tickets

Users with an active Support License can open support tickets to be dealt with quicker than waiting for the community via the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/UmbHost/UmbCheckout/issues).

You can submit a ticket through your [My.UmbHost](https://umbhost.net/clients/login) account.

If you need support urgently and are not currently licensed, you can [buy a license here](https://my.umbhost.net/store/umbraco-packages).
