# ðŸ›’ UmbCheckout Documentation

UmbCheckout is an eCommerce solution for Umbraco v10+ integrated with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout).

If you need a lightweight eCommerce solution for a site powered by Umbraco V10+ then UmbCheckout will allow you to make use of the Stripe Checkout service with minimal coding required.

Once the nuget package is installed it's completely possible to integrate it using the Views area of the Umbraco backoffice!

### Who These Docs Are For

**The documentation is aimed at developers** who have a basic understanding of Umbraco and at least an understanding of the Razor syntax.

The best place to start is the [Getting Started](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/uDVI1KElzKJfw9ON52uk/s/h5UHoyl8SSRgUKuYYLss/) section for details how to install and carry out the initial configuration.

**Before you can use this package you will need a** [**Stripe account**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)**.**
